# RSA Encryption & Decryption Tool

## 🔥 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Run the Script
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, open a terminal and run:
```bash
python script.py
```

### 2️⃣ Enter Prime Numbers
When prompted, enter two different prime numbers (e.g., `4391` and `6659`). These will be used to generate the public and private keys.

### 3️⃣ Choose an Option
Once the keys are generated, you will see a menu:
```
1. Encrypt a message
2. Decrypt a message
3. Exit
```
- **To encrypt a message**, enter `1` and type your message (e.g., `HELLO`). The script will generate the encrypted ciphertext.
- **To decrypt a message**, enter `2` and paste the ciphertext (comma-separated numbers) to get back the original message.
- **To exit**, enter `3`.

### 4️⃣ Example Usage
#### Encrypting:
```
Enter message to encrypt: HELLO
Ciphertext: [cipher_numbers_here]
```
#### Decrypting:
```
Enter ciphertext (comma-separated): [cipher_numbers_here]
Decrypted Message: HELLO
```

🚀 **That's it! Enjoy secure encryption with RSA!**
